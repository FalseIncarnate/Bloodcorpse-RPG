# Bloodcorpse-RPG

## Project Details
Bloodcorpse's RPG is a text-based RPG inspired by games such as Zork, Dungeons and Dragons, and  Thy Dungeonman.

Utilizing a minimal GUI, the intent is to provide a "retro" feeling game while avoiding the difficulties inherent to old text-parser input systems. As such, much of the game's information is displayed via text, and only the basic information is provided at all times to avoid cluttering the screen.

TODO: finish this
